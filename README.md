🚀 **Book Sales Data Analysis**

I recently explored a **Book Sales Dataset** using **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** to uncover key insights about publishing trends, author performance, and sales behavior. 📊

🔍 **Key Steps in My Analysis:**

* Cleaned and prepared the dataset (handled missing, duplicate, and invalid data)
* Visualized publishing trends with histograms and line charts
* Explored **genre-wise ratings and sales** using boxplots
* Analyzed **price vs. units sold** relationships
* Identified **top-performing authors** by total gross sales
* Examined **language distribution** and how it impacts book reach

📈 **Key Insights:**

* Sales showed steady growth over time, especially after 2000
* Certain genres consistently outperform others in both ratings and sales
* Price and units sold have an inverse correlation—lower prices often boost sales volume
* A handful of authors dominate the gross sales segment

🧠 **Tech Stack:**
`Python | Pandas | Matplotlib | Seaborn`

This project strengthened my skills in **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization** — key tools in turning raw data into actionable insights.
